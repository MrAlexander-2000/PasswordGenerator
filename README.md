# PasswordGenerator

This is a simple and secure password generator written in C#. I created it for my own personal use but I decided to share it!

## *Cool* Features

- **Custom Length:**  
  Choose any password length between 8 and 128 characters.

- **Adjustable Complexity:**  
  Select from three complexity levels:
  1. Lowercase letters and digits
  2. Uppercase and lowercase letters PLUS digits
  3. Uppercase, lowercase, digits AND special characters

## Wait, out of curiosity, why did you built this?

I built this because I DON'T TRUST most password generators and I also got tired of coming up with new passwords myself. So yeah that's why this little beauty come into existance.
